Description:
This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.

Challenge:
Challenge is to develop a 2D game called "So Long" using the MiniLibX library. The game should involve a main character collecting all the collectibles on a map and then finding the shortest route to the map's exit. The player should be able to move the character using the W, A, S, and D keys, with movement restricted by walls. The game should display the current number of movements in the shell and have a 2D graphical representation using the MiniLibX library.
